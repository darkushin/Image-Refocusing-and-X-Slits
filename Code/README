This project contains two separate programs:
1. Refocus GUI - this GUI allows the user to refocus on different objects in the scene, according to their depth in the
   real world. For best results, use a sequence with a small motion between every two consecutive frames.
2. X-Slits GUI - this GUI allows the user to create different slices in the space-time volume. The user can create full
   sized panoramas from different view-points, such as right-eye and left-eye view of the scene, a full view panorama
   from the left part of the first frame to the right part of the last (or vice versa if the motion is from right to left).
   Moreover, the GUI allows the user to create an affect of zoom-in on different parts of the sequence by changing the
   viewing angle in the space-time volume.

Note: Both GUI receive a video sequence broken down into frames as input.

   Installation
###################
In order to use the GUIs extract the zip file in an empty folder and run either Refocusing-Task.py or X-Slits-Task.py
for running the Refocus GUI and X-Slits GUI respectively. The program should create all the repositories and dependencies
required for it to run.

       Usage
###################

1. Refocus GUI:
   a. Run the Refocusing-Task.py program.
   b. Press the 'Select Folder' button. In the new opened window, navigate to the folder containing the desired sequence.
   c. Press the 'Compute Motion' button in order to compute the motion between every two consecutive frames in the
      sequence. If the sequence is a pure translation sequence, it is recommended to check the 'Translation-Only'
      checkbox BEFORE pressing the 'Compute Motion' button for better results.
   d. Focus on different objects in the pictured scene. This can be done in two ways:
      i. 'Left-Right' and 'Up-Down' buttons and entries. Pressing once every '+' and '-' button will shift the frames
         linearly by +0.5 and -0.5 pixels respectively. Entering a value to the entries under these buttons will shift
         the images linearly by the entered value. After defining the desired changes, press the 'Show' button in the
         bottom to display the new refocused image, calculated according to the specified motion. After the image is
         displayed, a new label will appear in the GUI, indicating the motion that was used to calculate the output image.
     ii. Pressing the 'Select Area' button. Pressing this button will open a new window with the middle image of the
         sequence as reference. Select a desired object to focus on in the image using the mouse and press the 'Done'
         button. Pressing this button will close the reference frame and create a new output image where the focus is
         on the selected area.
   e. Using Mean or Median: before pressing the ‘Show’ button the user is given the option to choose whether to compute
      the refocused image using the median or the mean of all the aligned and translated images. The default option is
      using the mean, but for the treasure sequence (see Results section) I found the median to produce better results.

   Notes:
     a. For using a different sequence go back to step a.
     b. The motion between every two consecutive frames is calculated only for the first time the sequence is used. If
        the sequence is re-used then the motion is loaded from a .csv file saving this information. If recomputing the
        motion is desired, then the motion file of the sequence should be deleted first. The motion file of the sequence
        is has the same name as the sequence folder and should be located in the Motion folder.
     c. Direct area selection – as explained before, pressing the 'Select Area' button will open a new window with the
        reference frame. In this window, do a left click with the mouse in the upper-left corner of the area you wish to
        focus on and drag the mouse (while holding it clicked) to the lower-right corner of the desired area. This will
        draw a doted rectangle on the image, indicating the area selected by the user. Changing the selected area can be
        done by the same logic again. After the user is satisfied with the selected region, the ‘Done’ button should be
        pressed. Pressing this button will close the current window and open a new window displaying the refocused image,
        where the focus is on the area selected by the user.


2. X-Slits GUI:
   a. Run the X-Slits-Task.py program.
   b. Press the 'Select Folder' button. In the new opened window, navigate to the folder containing the desired sequence.
   c. Press the 'Compute Motion' button in order to compute the motion between every two consecutive frames in the sequence.
   d. Define the initial slice in the Space-Time volume by filling the four available entries representing the start frame,
      end frame, start column and end column, by this order. Each number should be entered in the relevant entry. The
      possible values are from 0 to NUM_FRAMES-1 for the frame entries, and 0 to IMAGE_WIDTH-1 for the column entries.
      For your convenience, after selecting a sequence, the number of frames and the dimensions of an image in the sequence
      are presented in the upper-right corner of the GUI. The image shape is in the format of HEIGHT x WIDTH.
   e. After defining the endpoints, a panorama image can be created by pressing the ‘Show’ button in the bottom of the GUI.
      Pressing this window will open a new image with the resulting panorama image that was computed according to the
      endpoints defined by the user. For your convenience, after pressing this button a new label will appear above it,
      indicating the frames and columns ranges that were used to create the displayed panorama. The endpoints entries are
      being cleared to avoid confusion.
   f. Create new panoramas: after defining the initial endpoints of the panorama, new panoramas from different viewing
      points can be created in one of the following ways:
      i. Directly changing the slice endpoints by inserting values as explain in step 4.
     ii. Backward-Forward entry: this entry allows the user to insert a number to move the frames that are being moved
         forward/backward. For example, if the previous panorama was created using frames i and j as the start and end
         frames respectively, then filling the number n in this entry will create a panorama image using frames i+n to j+n
         and the same columns as defined before. In case i+n < 0 or j+n > NUM_FRAMES-1 an error message is displayed to
         the user (see Notes).
    iii. Left-Right entry: this entry allows the user to shift the start and end columns to the left/right. For example,
         if the previous panorama was created using columns k and l as the start and end columns respectively, then
         inserting the number n in this entry will create a panorama using the same frames as before but columns ranging
         from k+n to l+n. As in the previous case, if k+n < 0 or l+n>IM_WIDTH-1 an error message is displayed to the user
         (see Notes).
     iv. Zoom-in/out entry: this entry allows the user to insert an angle (-90 to 90) in which the current slice of the
         Space-Time volume should be rotated. * Inserting the value 0 will create a panorama defined by a vertical slice
         in the space time volume through the center of every frame.
         For values between 1 to 45 the used frames are fixed and the columns range changes. Notice that the frames that
         are used in this case are the frames defined by the user (not necessarily all the frames in the sequence).
         For values between 46 to 90 the used columns are fixed to be 0 and IM_WIDTH-1 and the frames that are being used
         are changing. This created a zoom-in affect as when the angle becomes larger the resulting panorama is smaller.
         Negative values have the exact analogical affect (same computation but defining the start column as bigger than
         the end column).
         For your convenience, after inserting a value to this entry, the entered value is displayed below the entry
         after creating the panorama image.
